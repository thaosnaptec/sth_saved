Under the folder /etc/init.d/ you will find all the init scripts for different boot up services, like apache2, networking, etc.

Depending on which runlevel the computer starts in, different services are started. So from the /etc/init.d/ folder each "service" is linked to one/many/no run level folders named from rc0.d to rc6.d.

To keep things simple there is a tool for removing/adding these links, hence removing or adding scripts to and from start up.

To disable apache2 simply type:

sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable
This disables apache2 at startup but is not removed so it can be enabled again. To remove the apache2 startup scripts do the following:

To remove apache2 simply type:

sudo update-rc.d -f  apache2 remove
